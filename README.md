<p align="center"><strong>This project is designed to simplify and automate the process of generating certificates in .docx format using python </strong></p>

## 🌟 Project Overview
This repository demonstrates how to use Python to create, customize, and convert certificates efficiently. It leverages powerful libraries like `python-docx`, `csv`, to handle document creation and conversion seamlessly.

## 📋 Features
- **Automated Certificate Creation**: Generate certificates in bulk from a CSV file containing recipient details.
- **Customizable Templates**: Use and modify `.docx` templates for certificate generation.
- **Directory Management**: Handle input and output directories for easy file management.
